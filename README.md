# Blurrator

ü™ôüñºÔ∏èü§ñ

## Overview

Blurrator is an automated bidding assistance tool for the Blur.io NFT marketplace, implemented during Season 2 of the Blur.io Airdrop program. This tool is available as a Google Chrome extension and significantly simplifies the bidding process on Blur.io by providing a centralized, all-in-one control panel for both reading information and performing quick actions that are not possible with the original Blur.io UI.

Blurrator also features an automated bid watcher that adjusts the current bid value based on the highest bid, preventing the user's bid from being liquidated. The tool offers a flexible set of configurations for automated bidding and a set of useful information on open bids including collection name, floor price, current top bid, user's bid, bid quantity, and total bid value, along with action hot buttons.
